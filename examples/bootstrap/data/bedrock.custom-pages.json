Specifically, they require jQuery, Popper.js, and our own JavaScript plugins. Place the following `<script>`s near the end of your pages, right before the closing `</body>` tag, to enable them. jQuery must come first, then Popper.js, and then our JavaScript plugins.\n\nWe use jQuery’s slim build, but the full version is also supported.\n\n> Curious which components explicitly require jQuery, our JS, and Popper.js? Click the show components link below. If you’re at all unsure about the general page structure, keep reading for an example page template.\n\n### Starter template\n\nBe sure to have your pages set up with the latest design and development standards. That means using an HTML5 doctype and including a viewport meta tag for proper responsive behaviors. Put it all together and your pages should look like this:\n\n```\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <!-- Required meta tags -->\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no\">\n\n    <!-- Bootstrap CSS -->\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css\" integrity=\"sha384-Gn5384xqQ1aoWXA+058RXPxPg6fy4IWvTNh0E263XmFcJlSAwiGgFAW/dAiS6JXm\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\">\n\n    <title>Hello, world!</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>\n\n    <!-- Optional JavaScript -->\n    <!-- jQuery first, then Popper.js, then Bootstrap JS -->\n    <script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js\" integrity=\"sha384-KJ3o2DKtIkvYIK3UENzmM7KCkRr/rE9/Qpg6aAZGJwFDMVNA/GpGFF93hXpG5KkN\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.12.9/umd/popper.min.js\" integrity=\"sha384-ApNbgh9B+Y1QKtv3Rn7W3mgPxhU9K/ScQsAP7hUibX39j7fakFPskvXusvfa0b4Q\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\n    <script src=\"https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/js/bootstrap.min.js\" integrity=\"sha384-JZR6Spejh4U02d8jOt6vLEHfe/JQGiRRSQQxSfFWpi1MquVdAyjUar5+76PVCmYl\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThat’s all you need for overall page requirements. Visit the Layout docs or our official examples to start laying out your site’s content and components.\n\n### Important globals\n\nBootstrap employs a handful of important global styles and settings that you’ll need to be aware of when using it, all of which are almost exclusively geared towards the normalization of cross browser styles. Let’s dive in.\n\n##### HTML5 doctype\n\nBootstrap requires the use of the HTML5 doctype. Without it, you’ll see some funky incomplete styling, but including it shouldn’t cause any considerable hiccups.\n\nBootstrap is developed mobile first, a strategy in which we optimize code for mobile devices first and then scale up components as necessary using CSS media queries. To ensure proper rendering and touch zooming for all devices, add the responsive viewport meta tag to your `<head>`.\n\n##### Box-sizing\n\nFor more straightforward sizing in CSS, we switch the global box-sizing value from content-box to border-box. This ensures padding does not affect the final computed width of an element, but it can cause problems with some third party software like Google Maps and Google Custom Search Engine.\n\nOn the rare occasion you need to override it, use something like the following:\n\n```\n.selector-for-some-widget {\n  box-sizing: content-box;\n}\n```\n\nWith the above snippet, nested elements—including generated content via ::before and ::after—will all inherit the specified box-sizing for that .selector-for-some-widget.\n\nLearn more about box model and sizing at CSS Tricks.\n\n##### Reboot\n\nFor improved cross-browser rendering, we use Reboot to correct inconsistencies across browsers and devices while providing slightly more opinionated resets to common HTML elements.\n\n##### Community\n\nStay up to date on the development of Bootstrap and reach out to the community with these helpful resources.\n\nFollow @getbootstrap on Twitter.\n\nRead and subscribe to The Official Bootstrap Blog.\n\nJoin the official Slack room.\n\nChat with fellow Bootstrappers in IRC. On the irc.freenode.net server, in the ##bootstrap channel.\n\nImplementation help may be found at Stack Overflow (tagged bootstrap-4).\n\nDevelopers should use the keyword bootstrap on packages which modify or add to the functionality of Bootstrap when distributing through npm or similar delivery mechanisms for maximum discoverability.\n\nYou can also follow @getbootstrap on Twitter for the latest gossip and awesome music videos.\n"

            "md": "A brief overview of Bootstrap’s features and limitations for the creation of accessible content.\n\n### Overview and Limitations\n\nThe overall accessibility of any project built with Bootstrap depends in large part on the author’s markup, additional styling, and scripting they’ve included. However, provided that these have been implemented correctly, it should be perfectly possible to create websites and applications with Bootstrap that fulfill WCAG 2.0 (A/AA/AAA), Section 508 and similar accessibility standards and requirements.\n\n### Structural markup\n\nBootstrap’s styling and layout can be applied to a wide range of markup structures. This documentation aims to provide developers with best practice examples to demonstrate the use of Bootstrap itself and illustrate appropriate semantic markup, including ways in which potential accessibility concerns can be addressed.\n\n### Interactive components\n\nBootstrap’s interactive components—such as modal dialogs, dropdown menus and custom tooltips—are designed to work for touch, mouse and keyboard users. Through the use of relevant WAI-ARIA roles and attributes, these components should also be understandable and operable using assistive technologies (such as screen readers).\n\nBecause Bootstrap’s components are purposely designed to be fairly generic, authors may need to include further ARIA roles and attributes, as well as JavaScript behavior, to more accurately convey the precise nature and functionality of their component. This is usually noted in the documentation.\n\n### Color contrast\n\nMost colors that currently make up Bootstrap’s default palette—used throughout the framework for things such as button variations, alert variations, form validation indicators—lead to insufficient color contrast (below the recommended WCAG 2.0 color contrast ratio of 4.5:1) when used against a light background. Authors will need to manually modify/extend these default colors to ensure adequate color contrast ratios.\n\n### Visually hidden content\n\nContent which should be visually hidden, but remain accessible to assistive technologies such as screen readers, can be styled using the .sr-only class. This can be useful in situations where additional visual information or cues (such as meaning denoted through the use of color) need to also be conveyed to non-visual users.\n\n```\n<p class=\"text-danger\">\n  <span class=\"sr-only\">Danger: </span>\n  This action is not reversible\n</p>\n```\n\nFor visually hidden interactive controls, such as traditional “skip” links, .sr-only can be combined with the .sr-only-focusable class. This will ensure that the control becomes visible once focused (for sighted keyboard users).\n\n`<a class=\"sr-only sr-only-focusable\" href=\"#content\">Skip to main content</a>`\n\n### Additional resources\n\n- Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0\n- The A11Y Project\n- MDN accessibility documentation\n- Tenon.io Accessibility Checker\n- Colour Contrast Analyser (CCA)\n- “HTML Codesniffer” bookmarklet for identifying accessibility issues"
